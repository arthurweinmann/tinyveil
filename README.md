# Vanilla Javascript Typesystem

This library provides a comprehensive suite of utility functions for type checking in vanilla JavaScript without the need for any additional frameworks or a compiler. It offers an immediate and proactive way of validating data types during the development process, which can be particularly useful in a language like JavaScript where types can be loosely defined It is very simple and aims at staying simple to use.These helper functions throw errors immediately when a type mismatch or invalid parameter is detected, facilitating early error discovery and making debugging easier. Furthermore, there's a function to verify if a given JSON object matches a specific schema, a feature which is quite useful when working with JSON data from an API. It makes debugging frontend to backend communication and inconsistencies easier. This library is a simple way to enforce strict type checking with zero maintenance costs.
